# Matching Mockups #003: Sign Up Form

## Standard Form

In this activity, you'll be creating a sign up form. You should aim to make your version look as identical as possible to the provided version. Matching the given mockups with absolute 100% accuracy is not expected, however, you should prioritize the objectives listed below.

# Basic Objectives

- Responsive design:
  - The form must be centered horizontally on any screen size (i.e. there is equal distance to the left and right of the form).
  - The input field lengths should change size depending on the size of the screen, so that the whole field is visible.
- There should be multiple input fields of different types.
- The password input field must validate its user inputs.
  - This means that this input field should use attributes for validation to display a built-in tooltip message when a user tries to click the submit button with an invalid input.
    - Example: a password less than 12 characters long.
- Some input fields should use the `required` attribute, meaning that the user cannot submit the form without entering an input into the required field.
